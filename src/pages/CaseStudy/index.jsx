                <h2 className="c-heading">Challenges</h2>
                <p className="c-title">
                    Programmics launched in 2018 with the ongoing demand for software products and solutions. As we had
                    been providing our high-end quality services and products to our clients since March 2019. After
                    that, due to the pandemic, we had seen a sudden decrease in volume as there was uncertainty all
                    around. We called an urgent meeting to overcome the challenges that are coming Infront of us. We
                    understood the fact that people are settling themselves as it was a devastating time for them. This
                    has never happened before. So definitely people were trying to accept the situation that is
                    hammering them from everywhere. After that, we had seen that people are losing their jobs. That was
                    a tough time for them. And it affects the market conditions as well. Because customer’s spending
                    capacity had been decreasing as they are left with limited earning options. People were not thinking
                    to upgrade themselves as that was the time of survival. Now the permanence and longevity became the
                    foremost priority. We were in an extensive dilemma how can we sustain in the market during this
                    difficult time? Because we acknowledged the truth that this is the time of survival. And to stay
                    during this tough time is the fundamental need of the market.

                <h2 className="c-heading">What Programmics did</h2>
                <p className="c-title">
                    Programmics is a well-built and strenuous software techno-friendly company. Therefore we sustained
                    well during the pandemic because of the following reasons that are mentioned below-
                </p>
                <p className="c-title">
                    – As we were highly dependent on system-built policies rather than on any human capital. During this
                    pandemic, we had seen the companies who were not automated, not able to sustain themselves. As we
                    are a technology-oriented company. So, it was not that much difficult for us to brawl for survival.
                    <br />
                    -We had created a strong and efficient Skilled team to work on the problems that people are facing
                    during the pandemic. And provided them with the solutions. We maintained the loyalty of our existing
                    customers by providing them the services that are most required during the pandemic. We understood
                    the problems and started working on them. So that we could meet the expectations of our customers.
                    <br />
                    – Our Strong and reliable backend systems helped us to confront the issues that are creating
                    confusion among the people. During that time, everything had changed. Old problems couldn’t exist
                    now. New ones had emerged and need to be resolved. That’s why our powerful backend systems helped us
                    to thrive during the pandemic.
                    <br />
                    – Consistent and efficient customer services were the key ingredients that help us to strive during
                    the tough time. We didn’t need to rely on a human interface as we had structured methodology and
                    techniques to resolve the problems of the customers and to deliver consistent and speedy services
                    without any delay.
                    <br />
                    -We maintained our goodwill as we were already working on the things that were the trending services
                    that were needed during the pandemic. We always believe to work on the things that are going to
                    create a revolutionary change in people’s life. We were able to handle the situations efficiently as
                    we were one of the leading companies in Web Development, Digital Marketing, Customized software and
                    app development, and Augmented reality.
                    <br />
                    -Our Marketing strategy helped us to preserve the oppression and constraint the hardship that became
                    the backbone of the pandemic. We came out from the bad break successfully and conclusively.
